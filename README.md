# UX/UI Design Portfolio
This is a centralised portfolio containing all of my UX/UI design work from the various projects I've done.

## *Doit* - Online To-do List (July 2024 - Present)
An online to-do list, created using HTML, JavaScript and CSS and bundled using the webpack bundler. This is an independent project entirely conceptualised and implemented by me. [You can find the full project in this repository.](https://github.com/liuworkgit/doit-webapp)

## *NetWorker* - Online Networking Service (July 2024)
An online networking service that links mentors and mentees and helps encourage professional connections. Created for Major League Hacking's 2024 Hack Your Portfolio hackathon. I worked as one of the UI designers and helped to create the project idea, style guide, and components. I also edited the submission description for readability. You can find the [completed project on Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/networker-i4qzdg) and the [source code in this repository.](https://github.com/amaciasmar/Networker)

## *Thrd* - Third Place Finder App Mockup (January 2024 - April 2024)
A prototype mockup of Thrd, an app that helps users find third places for connection and relaxation. Created for UBC's INFO 300 2023/24 final project. In this project, I was the main UI designer, and was thus responsible for the layout of the app's interface.
